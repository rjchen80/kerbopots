Texas hold 'em poker game is a game with simple rules but striking complication. This is due to the game's two characteristics: first, players have incomplete information about the game (including the payoff structure and the strategy of the other players); second, players are able to alter the payoff structure by a series of betting actions.

Our team, *kerbopots*, participated in the 2015 MIT Pokerbots Competition, which is a computer poker game using a variant of the Texas hold 'em tournament game called Three-player Pot-limit Sit-and-go Tournament. In the finished Casino and Mini-tournament part, our team got *third* and *fourth* place respectively.

More project details are described in `./report.pdf`.
